# Subscribe newsletter form

This project is for trying to understand how to use the [PHPMailer](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer)

## Requirements

### Backend
1. Local server `XAMPP, WAMP, MAMP, etc.` (For Windows, I recommend XAMPP)
2. Composer

## How to use

1. Clone this repository
2. Copy the backend folder to your local server(for XAMPP, copy to htdocs folder)
3. Run `composer install`
4. Go your database management system (phpmyadmin, adminer, etc.)
5. Create a database named `news_subscription`
6. Import the `news_subscription.sql` file to the database
7. Open the `database/database.php` file and change the database credentials.

After that, you can run the `frontend/public/index.html` file in your browser. You will see a form. Fill the form and submit. You will see the success message if the email is sent successfully. You can check the database to see the email address you submitted.

**_NOTE:_** You can directly run the `frontend/public/index.html` file in your browser without running backend. But, you will not see the success message. Because you need to run the in a PHP server for full functionality.
